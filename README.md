# toy-problems-python
This repository contains Python solutions for three programming challenges: converting 12-hr time to 24-hr time, checking for two positive numbers, and calculating the constant value of a string.

## Challenges
## Challenge 1: Converting 12-hr time to 24-hr time
Given a time in 12-hr format, this function converts it to 24-hr format. The function takes an hour, minute, and period as inputs and returns the time in 24-hr format

## Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive 
This function takes three integers as arguments and returns True if exactly two of them are positive numbers and False if otherwise.

## Challenge 3: Consonant value 
Given a lowercase srting with alphabetic characters only, this function returns the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters except "aeiou".
